--1 How many unique users exist in the logs dataset?
SELECT 
  COUNT (DISTINCT id) AS no_of_unique_users
FROM health.user_logs;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS user_measure_count ;
CREATE TEMP TABLE user_measure_count AS (
  SELECT 
    id,
    COUNT(*) AS measure_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT measure) AS unique_measures
  FROM health.user_logs
  GROUP BY id
);

--2 How many total measurements do we have per user on average rounded to the nearest integer?
SELECT 
  ROUND(AVG(measure_count), 2) AS avg_value
FROM user_measure_count;

--3 What about the median number of measurements per user?
SELECT 
  ROUND(
    CAST(PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY measure_count) AS NUMERIC),
    2
  ) AS median_value
FROM user_measure_count;

--4 How many users have 3 or more measurements?
SELECT 
  COUNT(id) AS no_of_users
FROM user_measure_count 
WHERE measure_count >= 3;

--5 How many users have 1,000 or more measurements?
SELECT 
  COUNT(id) AS no_of_users
FROM user_measure_count
WHERE measure_count >= 1000;

--6 How many users have logged blood glucose measurements?
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT id)
FROM health.user_logs
WHERE measure = 'blood_glucose';

--7 How many users have at least 2 types of measurements?
SELECT
  COUNT(*)
FROM user_measure_count
WHERE unique_measures >= 2;

--8 How many users have all 3 measures - blood glucose, weight and blood pressure?
SELECT 
  COUNT(*)
FROM user_measure_count
WHERE unique_measures = 3;

--9 For users that have blood pressure measurements, what is the median systolic/diastolic blood pressure values?
SELECT 
  --Systolic Blood Pressure Level
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY systolic) AS median_systolic,
  --Diastolic Blood Pressure Level
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY diastolic) AS median_diastolic
FROM health.user_logs
WHERE measure = 'blood_pressure';
